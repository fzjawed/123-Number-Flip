# 123-Number-Flip

This question was easy but I initially got the wrong answer because I missed ``' '`` ðŸ™‚ðŸ”ª

***Question: You are given an integer n consisting of digits 1, 2, and 3 and you can flip one digit to a 3. Return the maximum number you can make.***

Basically every number will only be made up of 1,2 or 3 and so you just have to find the first index that is not 3 and replace it with 3 and immediately break out of the loop. This question would be a little more complex if the numbers were made up of different digits I think.
